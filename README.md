# Sudoku-Solver-and-Generator

This project generates, solves and provides the user a platform to dynamically enjoy the game of sudoku in an interactive game format.The sudoku generator
has been specifically curated to suit the end user level by providing three difficulty levels (Easy,Medium and Hard). 

1. Python (.py) language has been used to code and an in-depth learning of functions, pygame module, libraries etc has been utilised. 
2. Pygame has been used as it is a fast way to prototype and most  coder friendly for understanding at the rudimentary level.
3. To give the user a "hands on feel", an additional feature, notes, has also been added and the feature of "Time" helps the user to track the solving time and subconsciously follow his/her improvement at the game.
4. If the user enters a false entry,an alert is immediately displayed so that the user can try again. 
5. After the user is confident in his/her solution, the program automatically checks with the answer, which has been obtained in the back end by using the algorithmic-technique of backtracking, which is used in many intellect based programs like chess etc.The approach to backtracking is similar to how the human brain solves the problem.

So this program enhances the experience of playing the brilliant, ancient game of Sudoku.
